## ROVER 

Read-pair overlap considerate variant-calling software for PCR-based massively parallel sequencing datasets.

#### Downloads

* [Source repository on github](https://github.com/bjpop/rover).

    You can download the ROVER source repository using git with this command:

    `git clone https://github.com/bjpop/rover` 

#### Description 

ROVER-PCR Variant Caller enables users to quickly and accurately identify
genetic variants from PCR-targeted, overlapping paired-end MPS datasets. The
open-source availability of the software and threshold tailorability enables
broad access for a range of PCR-MPS users.

This program is described in the paper [ROVER variant caller: read-pair overlap considerate variant-calling software
   applied to PCR-based massively parallel sequencing datasets](http://www.scfbm.org/content/9/1/3), published in Source Code for Biology and Medicine.
