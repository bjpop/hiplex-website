## UNDR ROVER 

A fast and accurate variant caller for targeted DNA sequencing.

#### Downloads

* [Source repository on github](https://github.com/bjpop/undr_rover).

    You can download the UNDR ROVER source repository using git with this command:

    `git clone https://github.com/bjpop/undr_rover`

#### Description 

UNDR ROVER is an improved version of our ROVER variant calling tool for
targeted DNA sequencing. It enables users to quickly and accurately identify
genetic variants from PCR-targeted, overlapping paired-end MPS datasets. It
calls the same variants as the ROVER tool but at a significantly reduced
runtime. It achieves its higher performance by avoiding read alignment before
variant calling, and can be applied directly to input FASTQ files.

This program is described in the paper [UNDR ROVER - a fast and accurate variant caller for targeted DNA sequencing](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/17/165), published in BMC Bioinformatics.

## ROVER 

Read-pair overlap considerate variant-calling software for PCR-based massively parallel sequencing datasets.

#### Downloads

* [Source repository on github](https://github.com/bjpop/rover).

    You can download the ROVER source repository using git with this command:

    `git clone https://github.com/bjpop/rover` 

#### Description 

ROVER-PCR Variant Caller enables users to quickly and accurately identify
genetic variants from PCR-targeted, overlapping paired-end MPS datasets. The
open-source availability of the software and threshold tailorability enables
broad access for a range of PCR-MPS users.

This program is described in the paper [ROVER variant caller: read-pair overlap considerate variant-calling software
   applied to PCR-based massively parallel sequencing datasets](http://www.scfbm.org/content/9/1/3), published in Source Code for Biology and Medicine.
