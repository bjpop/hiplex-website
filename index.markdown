Hi-Plex is a streamlined highly-multiplexed PCR-based target-enrichment system for massively parallel sequencing suitable 
for an extensive range of clinical and research applications. Hi-Plex is complemented by software for primer design and variant calling.

**NOTE:** improvements have been made to the Hi-Plex chemistry and primer design software. These developments have not yet appeared in the literature. [Contact](contact.html) the Hi-Plex team for information and collaboration enquiries.
