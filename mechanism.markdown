Hi-Plex chemistry employs:

 1. A small target size.
 2. A highly processive, high-fidelity polymerase.
 3. Permissive cycling conditions, spanning a gradient of annealing and extension temperatures at each cycle. This allows successful amplification across a range of primers and amplicon sequence contexts with different GC content.

With Hi-Plex, the PCR reaction does not rely on priming from gene-specific primers, which are only used to seed the reaction. Hi-Plex primers include a 5' heel which have adapter sequences to allow abridged universal adapter primers then full-length adapter primers added at later PCR cycles to drive the majority of the reaction. The adapters are hybrids containing 5' [Illumina TruSeq](http://truseq.illumina.com/truseq.html) and 3' [Life Technologies Ion Torrent](http://ioncommunity.lifetechnologies.com/) compatible sequences.
